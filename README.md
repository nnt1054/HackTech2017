# HackTech2017
Web Application built using Meteor.js at CalTech's hackathon, Hacktech.  Uses Spotify and Ticketmaster API to allow users to sign in and displays
concerts based on the artists that they listen to. Also allows users to sort the concerts returned by date, artist, and location.
Fixes: Need to refine the Ticketmaster query to speedup query time.
